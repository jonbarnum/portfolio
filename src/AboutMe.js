                Becoming an Emergency Room Nurse was my dream job. I had done a lot of research on different jobs and this career checked all of the boxes. Nursing school was not easy, but this vision gave me the determination and perseverance to succeed. After graduation, I landed my dream job. It had action, drama, variety, and almost everything I wanted in a career. As the years went on, I realized that my nursing career left me feeling incomplete. Through friends and colleagues, I came to realize that I needed to be courageous and step into the unknown world of web development.

                Was I scared? Yes, without a doubt. I was leaving something behind that I was very accustomed to. I had the skills I needed to deliver wonderful care to those who walked in the emergency room doors. I walked into the unknown with relatively no web development skills. The languages where foriegn and the processes were complicated, but I quickly discovered that this type of challenging environment made me feel complete.

                Web development presents problems that I get to solve every day. These challenges feed my constant desire to learn. I get to dig deep to find specific answers and break concepts into small management pieces. I get to step back and look at the large picture and figure out how everything works together. Web development gives me the opportunities to work with my teammates and ask for help when I get stuck. Nursing helped me refine my adaptability skills and I get to now apply them in the web development field. I love the learning, problems, and teamwork that this field offers me.

                I took a terrifying risk, but that risk paid off. I have learned much and continue to learn each and every day. My persistent endurance has led me down the path of continual learning. I have learned html, css, javascript, react, git/github, node.js, express.js, and mongoDB. Each day, I learn something new or a new way of doing something. It’s a humbling experience to walk down the web development path – it has turned into a newfound passion that I wake up excited about every morning.
